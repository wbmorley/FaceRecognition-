# FaceRecognition-
Face recognition project - two parts. 

Face detect 
First part that needs to be run is face detect which will detect all the faces within the inputed image. The individual faces will be highlighted by a rectangle on the whole image. Then the individual photos will be shown for user to input the name. Faces and photos will be saved to indivudal directories

Face Recog 
Run an image through face recog to find people that have already been detected and tagged in the previous step. Must select a directory of photos rather than an indvidual photo. Each photo will be shown until the user presses a key at which the next photo is shown until the directory has been traversed. 

**must change hardcoded directory in face recog
